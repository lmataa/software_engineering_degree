# CDI_unity

AR package for Vuforia with Unity. 

ImageTargets are atoms cards that then when scanned displays a 3d model of an atom.

You can join two targets to generate a molecule and render it.

Tap in tactile devices or "I" in keyboards to display a UI that will show you more information about that element or molecule.
